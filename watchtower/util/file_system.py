"""This module contains convenience functions for file system operations
involving recordings.

Watchtower stores recordings in the following directory structure:
watcthower/
   instance/
      recordings/           <- Contains allÂ camera recordings.
         YYYY-mm-dd/        <- Contains all recordings for that day.
            HH.MM.SS/       <- Contains a single recording triggered at that timestamp.
               trigger.jpg  <- The motion frame that triggered the recording.
               video.h264   <- The full recording video.
