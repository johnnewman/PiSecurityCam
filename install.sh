# This script installs all of the necessary dependencies for Watchtower to run.
# In summary:
# - Installs all system libs and python dependencies for Watchtower.
# - Installs Icebox and its dependencies for cooling the system.
# - Configures a Firewall to only allow HTTP(S) and SSH traffic.
# - Schedules a cron job to manage disk usage.
# - Creates systemd services for Watchtower and Icebox.
# - Creates the log directory for Watchtower and the cron job.
# - Creates a simple Watchtower configuration to only save motion to disk.
# - Copies the nginx app gateway config file to access Watchtower via uWSGI.
# 
# Additional setup to the watchtower_config file is needed to enable Dropbox
# uploads and microcontroller support, described in the output.

Final steps to take:\n\
1) REQUIRED: Enable camera access via 'sudo raspiconfig'\n\
2) Optional: To use the HTTP API and frontend:
    2.1) Upload SSL certificates to \"$WATCHTOWER_PATH/nginx/certs\". You will need:\n\
        - A public SSL certificate.
        - The corresponding private key. These two used for encrypting traffic.
        - A certificate authority cert for validating clients. Necessary to restrict access to trusted users.
        These 3 files must match the names defined in \"$WATCHTOWER_PATH/.env\":\n\
            - 'SSL_CERT=wt.crt'\n\
            - 'SSL_CERT_KEY=wt.key'\n\
            - 'SSL_CLIENT_CERT=ca.crt'\n\
    2.2) Enter the IP address (typically the reverse proxy address) allowed to access this machine by editing 'ALLOWED_CLIENT_IP=' in \"$WATCHTOWER_PATH/.env\"\n\
3) Optional: To use a microcontroller, you will need to:\n\
    3.1) Enable serial access via 'sudo raspiconfig'\n\
    3.2) Set 'SERIAL_ENABLED=1' in \"$WATCHTOWER_PATH/.env\"\n\
    3.3) Configure servo angles in \"$WATCHTOWER_PATH/config/watchtower_config.json\"\n\
4) Optional: Configure the reverse proxy with an upstream location to this machine. See \"$WATCHTOWER_PATH/ancillary/nginx/reverse_proxy\"\n\
5) Optional: Configure \"$WATCHTOWER_PATH/config/watchtower_config.json\" with Dropbox support."
